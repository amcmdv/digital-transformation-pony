# üéÆ Digital Transformation Decision Simulation Game

Welcome to the **Digital Transformation Decision Simulation Game**! This is an interactive JavaScript-based simulation where you take on the role of a decision-maker, managing the digital transformation of an organization. You'll navigate various challenges, from selecting the right project management methodology to dealing with geopolitics and the infamous "cargo cult" mentality.

In this game, you will:
- Choose from a range of stakeholders (CEO, CTO, Consultant, Politician).
- Decide which project management approach to follow: **Agile**, **Waterfall**, or **Agile-Agnostic**.
- See how factors like experience, certification, and geopolitical risks affect the outcome.
- Understand how superficial project management knowledge (Cargo Cult) can impact your project's success.

üöÄ Let's dive into how you can use this game to explore the fascinating world of **digital transformation** and **strategic decision-making**.

## üéØ Game Overview

This simulation focuses on **decision-making** in the context of a digital transformation project. You‚Äôll explore how different factors such as **methodologies**, **stakeholder expertise**, **geopolitical risks**, and the **Cargo Cult** mindset affect project success.

### Game Mechanics

1. **Stakeholder Selection**:
    - **CEO (Experienced, Certified)**: The seasoned leader with certification to back their skills.
    - **CTO (Experienced, Uncertified)**: A technically sharp decision-maker but lacks formal certification.
    - **Consultant (Trained, Certified)**: A professional expert with up-to-date credentials.
    - **Politician (Untrained, Uncertified)**: Politically savvy, but lacking both experience and certifications.

2. **Project Methodology**:
    - **Agile**: Fast, iterative, and flexible, but does it always work?
    - **Waterfall**: Traditional and structured, but can it adapt to modern needs?
    - **Agile-Agnostic**: A flexible hybrid, but does it offer the best of both worlds?

3. **Outcome Factors**:
    - **Geopolitical Risk**: Political instability and external geopolitical factors can disrupt your project.
    - **Cargo Cult Mentality**: Having a surface-level understanding of methodologies can hurt your project.
    - **Experience & Certification**: Stakeholder experience and certification can boost or hinder your success.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Choose a Stakeholder**:
   Pick a role (CEO, CTO, Consultant, Politician) based on experience and certification levels. This will affect how the project unfolds!

2. **Select a Project Methodology**:

3. **Watch the Simulation**:
   Once you've made your choices, the game will calculate your project‚Äôs success probability based on:
   - The stakeholder‚Äôs influence (experience, certification).
   - Geopolitical risks and external political stability.
   - The impact of the cargo cult mentality on the project.

4. **View Results**:
   The game will display whether your project succeeds or fails, along with the specific factors that contributed to the result.

## üõ†Ô∏è Game Code Breakdown

This simulation is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Below is a brief explanation of the core elements:

- **Stakeholders**: Each stakeholder is defined by two attributes: **experience** and **certification**, affecting their influence on the project‚Äôs outcome.
- **Methodologies**: Success rates are pre-defined for Agile, Waterfall, and Agile-Agnostic approaches. These rates get modified based on stakeholder influence and external factors.
- **Geopolitical and Cargo Cult Factors**: Randomly generated variables introduce real-world unpredictability to the outcome, just like in real-world digital transformation projects.
